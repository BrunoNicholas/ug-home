Uganda has had alot of challenges which birth other challenges that make solving such hard concerning justice in the country. UG-Home looks at family violence as it impacts on the children that may have or have not the right medium of expression from all areas of Uganda to the right government officials or community support organisations.

## Description
More than 1 million serious family justice problems occur in Uganda every year: most of them are domestic violence and separation related. ~ Hiil 2017
Challenges arising from stress-related illness (64%), problems with relationships (47%), and loss of time (35%) are the most widespread consequences such as abandonment of children, lack of education, HIV, loss of work and opportunities to maintain the family as likely impacts.
Relationships between men, women and children are complicated. Not all relationships are formalized and the legal framework for resolving disputes in such relationships is unclear, for instance a domestic relations bill has been pending in parliament for 50 years

### Case Reporting
Most people consult family members, friends and family heads. 61% did not consult formal sources of information but those who did refered to local councils and Police, clan leaders and religious leaders have overlapping roles.
Solution: 50% asks family members, elders, clan leaders or other people in their network to intervene. 40% uses LCCs, police and other “formal” dispute resolution processes
